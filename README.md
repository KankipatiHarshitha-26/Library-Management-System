# 📚 Library Management System (Django)

## 📌 Description

This project is a **Library Management System** web application built using the Django framework. It allows users to log in, view available books, issue and return them, and manage library records. Django’s built-in admin panel is used to add and manage books efficiently.

This project helped deepen my understanding of:
- Django web development
- Authentication systems (Login/Logout)
- Book issuing and returning logic
- Managing the Django development server and resolving common issues

It was developed as part of an internship, enhancing my backend development and debugging skills.
